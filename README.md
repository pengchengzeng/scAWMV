# scAWMV 
We propose scAWMV for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data. It takes into account both the importance of each source of multi-omic data and the link between the two datasets. scAWMV generates some biologically meaningful low dimensional representations for the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles via unsupervised learning.
